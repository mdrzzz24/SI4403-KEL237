ROZAN
There's no way to time it
And where you may find it is unknown
Until then, you're a loner
So you see her (see her)
She's over (over) in the corner (corner)
And you can't (you can't) ignore her (you can't ignore her)
There must be a reason
You see it, believe it now

NIJAR
Search the definition of shame
I'm sure you'll see my face
Who's gonna save me now?
I hope it's you, my babe

MELA
See her
She's over in the corner
And I can't ignore her
I hope there's a reason
To see it, I see it now (now, oh)
