ROZAN
There's no way to time it
And where you may find it is unknown
Until then, you're a loner
So you see her (see her)
She's over (over) in the corner (corner)
And you can't (you can't) ignore her (you can't ignore her)
There must be a reason
You see it, believe it now

NIJAR
Search the definition of shame
I'm sure you'll see my face
Who's gonna save me now?
I hope it's you, my babe

AMARA
Don't change a thing, you are amazing
I can't believe you've come and saved me
We can stay here, spend every day here
I don't mind, no

SULE
Don't change a thing, you are amazing
I can't believe you've come and saved me
We can stay here, spend every day here
I don't mind
